# 30-DAY-SOLIDITY

The title says it all this is basically going to be a little challange that I am going to got through to be able to actually learn solidity within this mont, hopefully I end up getting though everything that needs to be done at the same time learn a few things. Not only that be able to explain and understand as well as build a creative style for myself as well. 

Just need to get myself into something as well as motivate myself as well. At the most part I will be folling tutorials as well as learning up online by reading documentation and I guess maybe blogs too but for the most part going to really push myself to actually get right into the code.
